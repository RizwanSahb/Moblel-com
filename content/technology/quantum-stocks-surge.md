Quantum computing stocks lit up the markets this week, with investors pouring into the sector following a wave of promising developments.

Shares of **Rigetti Computing**, **D-Wave Quantum**, and **Quantum Computing Inc.** all jumped more than 20%. Leading the charge, Rigetti surged after announcing $5.7 million in new purchase orders for two of its Novera quantum systems.

Meanwhile, **Arqit Quantum** skyrocketed over 40% this week, riding the same wave of optimism that’s pushing quantum tech closer to the mainstream.

Adding fuel to the rally, the **Danish government** and the owner of pharmaceutical giant **Novo Nordisk** committed **€300 million** (about $317 million) to a new quantum venture fund. The move signals growing global confidence in the field's long-term promise.

At the same time, **Nvidia** released a blog post spotlighting the role of accelerated computing in driving quantum breakthroughs.

Big tech is circling, too.

**Microsoft**, **Amazon**, and **Nvidia** have all announced new hardware, multi-million dollar investments, and expanded research into quantum computing this year.

While there’s still a long road ahead, momentum is clearly building.

Between government funding, corporate investments, and real product orders, quantum computing is starting to look less like science fiction—and more like the next computing revolution.
